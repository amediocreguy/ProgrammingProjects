This will help you create a day night cycle in Unity

## 1. Create your scene

Once you have created your project in unity, I am using the 3D project base.
Open unity and create a scene with whatever name you wish.
I named my scene DayNight.

## 2. Create your scripts

Create two Scripts one called 'LightingPreset' this will hold the preset we create for lighting conditions.

The other script will be called 'LightingManager' This will control the lighting conditions in the scene allowing for control as the time of day changes.
