## 1 Creating our scene

To start off I have created a default 3D unity scene and made a simple "Lamp" that can act as our switchable object. (For me, I have simply used a cube).
And have imported the 3rd person character controller from the asset store.

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526

Start out by opening the `Playground` scene in the editor, this willl give you a character and controller to work with and a small scene where you can place your lamp.
